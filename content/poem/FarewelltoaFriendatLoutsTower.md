- 王昌龄
- 寒雨连江夜入吴，

- 平明送客楚山孤。

- 洛阳亲友如相问，

- 一片冰心在玉壶。

- A cold rain mingled with East Stream invades the night;

- At dawn you leave the lonely Southern Hill in haze.

- If my friends in the North should ask if I'm all right,

- My heart is free of stain as ice in crystal vase.

- translated by Xu Yuanchong
